# Stock-Analysis

I used sklearn to gather data for google stocks. For data collection I used Quandl. The data is then cleaned up and meaningful features are extracted over them. Data of a limited number of datys are used as input features( like openeing and closing and the highs and lows) and the outputs are after that number of limited days.

Initially tested this over simple regression and decision trees, however this data is improvised by using a ensemble of various machine learning approaches.
